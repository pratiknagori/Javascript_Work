Big O notation:
Running time of an alogirthm or a piece of code.


#Linear search
left to right one by one

good alogirthm if u dont know what the order of data inside an array is



Hi,


OOPS:
I have gone through the OOPS concept videos. They are clear and gave good understanding of the pillars of OOPS programming.
I am still struggling to completelty understand Encapsualtion concept.
I understood that Encapsulation can be defined as Binding variables and methods into single entity.
However, how it can be useful or maybe an example will help me better.
I will go through other videos to try and understand it.

There is gap between 2 and 3 lecture, related to arrays
There are some things mentioned about List, sets, maps , tree which arent clear to me. What are list, maps reference did not understand.
When to use list, when to use arrays.Need to check these things but I will figure them out. if anything i will call.

Maybe a silly question but are method and function is one and the same thing in Programming language? or there is a difference.

I am going through Arrays and Algorithms classes below:

Have gained fair amount of understanding about Arrays and various types of Algorithms from above
Big O Notation
Linear Search
Binary Search
Sorting and Searching vs. Just Searching
String Comparison
Storing Data in Arrays
Structs
Sorting
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort

Addition to above,
I am continuing my Javascript tutorials which will include Datastructrues, Arrays and OOPS surrounding them.

All my work is coding assignments and challenges as part of Javascript tutorials and work are commited under:
https://github.com/pratiknagori/Javascript_Work.git
I will start work on my SAAS assignments as well now 





Last lecture was not clear,

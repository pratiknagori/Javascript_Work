OBJECT
CLASS

Pillars of OOPS:
ABSTRACTION
ENCAPSULATION
INHERITANCE
POLYMORPHISM


#CLASS
It is a blueprint that an object follows (furniture). WIthout class, there is no objects.
It has n number of object 
A furniture can have different object (1 chair, 1 table, 1 desk etc) which will follow the same blueprint (properties) ie color, size 

WHAT THIS CLASS KNOWS (becomes properties)
WHAT THIS CLASS DOES (becomes methods)


#OBJECT
It is a real work entity (1 chair) which has properties and it has some tasks to be performed
It is an instance of a class
Example:
Chair
properties like color, size etc
tasks like support

An OBJECT follows the same structure as the CLASS

#Classes cannot communicate with each other. to do that, you create objects of classes and OBJECTS communicate with each other.

#ABSTRACTION
Showing only essential part and hiding the implmentation. Abstract class cannot be instantiated. it needs to be sub-classed to have its objects created
Example:
DOwnloading a software, we get .exe software
We cannot see the packages, or classes or methods or functions we used

#ENCAPSULATION
Binding variables and methods into single entity

Class has names, variables and methods
Objects have names, variables and methods


CLASS

Name
Variables
Methods

Example:
CLASS:
Student  --> Name
name, roll no, DOJ  --> variables
read(), write(), play()  --> methods

#INHERITANCE
Acquiring the properties of one class to another class.
Parent (Base) Class --> Child (Derived) Class

types:
Single
Multi Level
Hierarchial 

#POLYMORPHISM
Performing the same task (method) in different ways
Example:
Add ()
Add (int a , int b)

Both are doing same task, but implementation is different

DrawPolygon ()
polygon can ve anything rectangle, traingle, square
This can be achieved in Java using method overloading (compile time polymorphism) and method overiding (runtime polymorphism)

Not all propeties of class , but only specific properties of a class can be used


Questions:
What is class and subclass.
Gap between 2 and 3 lecture, related to arrays
List, sets, maps , tree
method and function is one and the same thing
Last lecture was not clear, 
what re list, maps reference did not understand.
When to use list, when to use arrays.

understood that memory allocation in arrays are sequential as fixed

understood teh binary search algorithm
however, did not understand when to use array, when to use list

Sorting algorithms
